This repository contains an ARMv8 multicore virtual platform.
It was built at the Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems at RTWH Aachen University.
The following target software configurations were tested (see [config](config/)):

- CoreMark
- Dhrystone
- Linux single- and dual-core
- Xen single- and dual-core

## Build & Installation

In order to build `avp64`, you need a working installation of `vcml` and its components.
For that please follow the installation guideline of `vcml` which can be found [here](https://github.com/machineware-gmbh/vcml).

1. Clone git repository including submodules:

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aut0/avp64
    ```

2. Chose directories for building and deployment:

    ```bash
    <source-dir>  location of your repo copy,     e.g. /home/lukas/avp64
    <build-dir>   location to store object files, e.g. /home/lukas/avp64/BUILD
    <install-dir> output directory for binaries,  e.g. /opt/avp64
    ```

3. Patch submodules: Two patches can be applied to patch the `ocx-qemu-arm` submodule.

    - [ocx-qemu-arm-disable-tests.patch](./patches/ocx-qemu-arm-disable-tests.patch): This patch adds an option to the ocx-qemu-arm projects which allows disabling the tests of the submodule.
    - [ocx-qemu-arm-fix_unicorn_debug_build.patch](./patches/ocx-qemu-arm-fix_unicorn_debug_build.patch): This patch enables a debug build of unicorn when the project is build with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` equals `DEBUG`, `Debug` or `debug`.
    - [unicorn-fix-breakpoint.patch](./patches/unicorn-fix-breakpoint.patch): This patch fixes the breakpoint behavior of the VP.
    Without this patch, the VP executes the instruction on a breakpoint hit and stops after the execution.
    The patch stops the VP before the instruction is executed.
    - [unicorn-fix-wfi-hint.patch](./patches/unicorn-fix-wfi-hint.patch): This patch fixes the *Wait for Interrupt* (WFI) hint of unicorn.
    Without this patch, WFI instructions are not forwarded to avp64 which decreases the simulation performance.

    To apply the patches, execute:

    ```bash
    (cd <source-dir>/deps/ocx-qemu-arm && git apply <source-dir>/patches/ocx-qemu-arm-disable-tests.patch)
    (cd <source-dir>/deps/ocx-qemu-arm && git apply <source-dir>/patches/ocx-qemu-arm-fix_unicorn_debug_build.patch)
    (cd <source-dir>/deps/ocx-qemu-arm/unicorn && git apply <source-dir>/patches/unicorn-fix-breakpoint.patch)
    (cd <source-dir>/deps/ocx-qemu-arm/unicorn && git apply <source-dir>/patches/unicorn-fix-wfi-hint.patch)

    ```

4. Configure and build the project using `cmake`. During configuration you must
   state whether or not to build the unit tests:

     - `-DBUILD_TESTS=[ON|OFF]`: build unit tests (default: `OFF`)

   Ensure that the environment variable `SYSTEMC_HOME` is correctly set.
   Release and debug build configurations are controlled via the regular
   parameters:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p <build-dir>
   cd <build-dir>
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE <source-dir>
   make -j 4
   sudo make install
   ```

   If building with `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` you can run all unit tests using
   `make test` within `<build-dir>`.

5. After installation, the following new files should be present:

    ```bash
    <install-dir>/bin/avp64                # executable program
    <install-dir>/config/                  # configuration files
    <install-dir>/lib/libocx-qemu-arm.so 
    ```

6. If the library `libocx-qemu-arm.so` cannot be found, add the lib folder to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/avp64/lib/
    ```

----

## Run

Run the platform using a [config](config/) file:

```bash
<install-dir>/bin/avp64 -f <install-dir>/config/<config-file>
```

For more details on run parameters please look [here](https://github.com/machineware-gmbh/vcml).  


To stop the platform, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> .

To install tested software that belongs to the provided [configuration files](config/), follow the installation guide of [avp64_sw](https://github.com/aut0/avp64_sw).
After the installation, set the environment variable `AVP64_SW` to the path of the `avp64_sw` repository:

```bash
export AVP64_SW=<software-repository>
```

Execute the setup script, which is in `avp64/`, to copy and integrate the installed software:  

```bash
./setup.sh
```

----

## Maintaining Multiple Builds

Debug builds (i.e. `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG`) are intended for developers
that like to make changes on `avp64` and want to track down bugs.
Note that these builds operate significantly slower than optimized release
builds and should therefore not be used for VPs that are used productively,
e.g. for target software development.
Ensure that the environment variable `SYSTEMC_HOME` is correctly set.  
To maintain both builds from a single source repository, try the following:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aut0/avp64 && cd avp64  

home=$PWD
for type in "DEBUG" "RELEASE"; do
    install="$home/BUILD/$type"
    build="$home/BUILD/$type/BUILD"
    mkdir -p $build && cd $build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$type -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$install $home
    make install
done
```

Afterward, you can find the builds in:

```bash
<source-dir>/avp64/BUILD/DEBUG    # for the debug build or
<source-dir>/avp64/BUILD/RELEASE  # for the release build
```
